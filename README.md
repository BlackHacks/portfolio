This is the source code for my [personal website](http://piotry.me).

# Why build one?

Cuz it's fun, don't you think? Besides, I learned a ton of new technologies!

The best way to learn something is by hacking it down somehow somewhere.

# Why Open source?

You seriously asking dat?? **sad**

Open source is a way of thinking and living. ``;)`` Besides, this website is built on top of open source software!

# The tech goodies

Plenty of OSS used here:

## Backend Stack

<table><tr><th>Server</th><td><a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a></td><td><a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js</a></td><td><a href="http://brunch.io">brunch.io</a></td></tr></table>
__Why?__

I love node!. But I don't need a full-stack framework, so express would do the job. (Sinatra would have been my ruby choice)

Brunch.io is a beautiful tool that is agnostic of the framework you use. It helps me concatenate and uglify/minify my client side js and css. 
The ``client`` folder is the one under brunch's control.

## Frontend Stack

<table><tr><th>MVC</th><th>Templating</th><th>Libraries</th></tr><tr><td><a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a></td><td><a href="http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/">stylus</a></td><td><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">twitter-bootstrap</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="http://coffeescript.org/">coffeescript</a></td><td><a href="http://jade-lang.com/">jade</a></td><td><a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">raphaeljs</a></td></tr></table>

__Why?__

<table><tr><th>MVC</th><th>Templating</th><th>Libraries</th></tr><tr><td><p>Ember seamed easier at first, but I'll definitely give backbone a try soon enough! Coffeescript works pretty nicely with brunch and it's a nice language to use. </p></td><td><p>Standard templating engines in the node community. </p></td><td><p>Bootstrap is extremely useful and there is no reason not to use it! (No worries, I don't use all of it, only the parts we need.  <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/customize.html">hint</a></p></td></tr></table>

# Tools

Here's what I use when I develop apps including this one:

  - vim.
  - git and especially [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).
  - [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto), an oh-my-zsh refactoring that I personnaly find more robust and neat.
  - [skwp/dotfiles](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles), that are awesome though lack some node support. ([Pull requests](https://github.com/tUrG0n/dotfiles) on the way ^^ )
  - midnight commander (mc)
  - tmux
