This is the source code for my [personal website](http://piotry.me).

## Why build one?

Cuz it's fun, don't you think? Besides, I learned a ton of new technologies!

The best way to learn something is by hacking it down somehow somewhere.

## Why Open source?

You seriously asking dat?? **sad**

Open source is a way of thinking and living. ``;)`` Besides, this website is built on top of open source software!

## Tech stack?

Plenty of OSS used here:

----

### Backend Stack

__Server__

  - Node.js 
	- [express.js](http://expressjs.com/)
	- [brunch.io](http://brunch.io)

__Why?__

I love node!. But I don't need a full-stack framework, so express would do the job. (Sinatra would have been my ruby choice)

Brunch.io is a beautiful tool that is agnostic of the framework you use. It helps me concatenate and uglify/minify my client side js and css. 
The ``client`` folder is the one under brunch's control.

----

### Frontend Stack

__MVC__

  - [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/)

__Why?__

Ember seamed easier at first, but I'll definitely give backbone a try soon enough!

--

__Templating__

  - [jade](http://jade-lang.com/)
	- [stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/)

__Why?__

Standard templating engines in the node community.

--

__Libraries__
  - [twitter-bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
	- [raphaeljs](http://raphaeljs.com/)

__Why?__

Bootstrap is extremely useful and there is no reason not to use it! (No worries, I don't use all of it, only the parts we need. [hint](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/customize.html) )

----

### Tools

Here's what I use when I develop apps including this one:

  - vim.
	- git and especially [git-flow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow).
	- [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto), an oh-my-zsh refactoring that I personnaly find more robust and neat.
	- [skwp/dotfiles](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles), that are awesome though lack some node support. ([Pull requests](https://github.com/tUrG0n/dotfiles) on the way ^^ )
	- midnight commander (mc)
	- tmux
